        Welcome to my website! I am a developer who loves to learn about the latest in software and data 
        and integrate that into solutions and projects. I have had an opportunity to apply 
        my skills and learn best practices from my internship at BlueCat, hackathons, and personal projects.

        Some of my personal interests are sports such as soccer and basketball, 
        music and concerts, 
        and finding ways to get a deeper understanding of the world around me.
