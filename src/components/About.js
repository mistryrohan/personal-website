      Welcome to my website! I am a developer who loves to learn about the latest in software and data 
      and integrate that into solutions and projects. I have had an opportunity to apply 
      my skills and learn best practices from my internship at BlueCat, hackathons, and personal projects. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Some of my personal interests are sports such as soccer and basketball, 
        music and concerts, 
        and finding ways to get a deeper understanding of the world around me.
