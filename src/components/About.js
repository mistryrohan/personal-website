      Welcome to my website! I am a developer who loves to learn about the latest in software and data and integrate that into solutions and projects. I have had an opportunity to apply my skills and learn best practices from my internship at BlueCat, hackathons, and personal projects.

      <p>Some of my personal interests are sports such as soccer and basketball, music and concerts, and finding ways to get a deeper understanding of the world around me.</p>
